        <p>
            After wrapping up the whole of The Last of Us Remastered (TLOU), the additional DLC, <a href="http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/left-behind.php">left behind</a>, was really (*ahem*) left behind in my mind.
   i initially thought it would be another set of missions that really couldn’t top the oh-so-ambiguous ending of the main game.
   tlou remastered (and of course, left behind) are developed by naughty dog and published by sony computer entertainment for the playstation 4, both have an esrb rating of m for mature.
   bundled in with the tlou remastered edition, left behind can easily function as a standalone game, as it does not exclusively reference tlou’s main story much in its playtime.
   usually, dlc expansions are par for the course; they often add new maps, sprinkle in meaningless dialogue, and stretch out their parent game (often to distasteful ends).
   however here, this expansion deviates from the main game and focuses much more on human emotions and story, rather than gameplay.
   i think, on the whole, this sliver of content achieves things that the tlou couldn’t, and i’m happier for it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Left Behind follows the main game’s young protagonist Ellie, and friend Riley, as they traverse a dilapidated shopping mall in their post-apocalyptic “hometown” (quarantine zone, Boston).
    These sequences are flashbacks and are intermittently cut with levels in which “present day” Ellie scours for medical supplies (without giving too much away) in an equally unwelcoming mall in the midst of winter.
    As in the main game, the threat of “infected” is still integral (albeit less so) to the game play as nimble Ellie fights the infected with a limited arsenal of weapons in the present day.
    The flashbacks scenes are what really matter. While they don’t fit the games “action” genre, they show amazingly human interactions between Ellie and Riley.
    Firstly, the overall dialogue is pitch-perfect and shows how real teenagers would speak to each other.
    In one portion of the flashback, the two girls butt heads, and after a while (to ease the tension), Ellie (in game) starts to tell corny jokes from “No Pun Intended: Volume Too”.
    Peppered with awkward laughter and teenage bickering, I genuinely felt as though the dialogue was real and never did the DLC go into “uncanny valley” territory.
    <br />
    <br />
    Massive points go to the games story.
    Specifically, the “past” sequences are entirely dependent on story, as combat is nearly non-existent.
    Small interactions (often optional) open up quaint details about the characters and near the end, the game features a revelation that is unprecedented in the gaming medium.
    Also, like TLOU, the entire framework of the game is held together by solid graphics and smooth controls that don’t get in the way.
    <br />
    <br />
    The negatives here can only be called nitpicks. The game is short. I finished it in two good sittings (4.5 hours).
    Those looking for more dynamic combat sequences should be wary, as this game does not cater to those fans.
    And lastly, some of the hard combat moments felt a little heavy handed (and perhaps done to extend the playtime).
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="closer">
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        Overall, this expansion was an emotional ride that went places wholly unexpected from videogames. In the end I felt slightly bewildered (in a good way), shocked, and satisfied.
        Left Behind expanded an already fantastic game; it compounded the experience and is definitely worth a play.

            As the non-descript package from amazon arrived in my mail (day 1 delivery, mind you), I felt a palpable sense of joy.
             “Finally, it’s here”, every pore of my body rang. Yes, I played the demo, and played the original Gamecube version until it finally burned out. 
            I missed the newer iterations so this moment was novel, and signified a marked return to form for me. 
            As I popped in <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/"> Super Smash Bros. for the 3ds</a>, the snappy menu appeared and i spent a few solid seconds clicking and navigating options.
   i played the classic mode out the gate with pac-man. it felt…familiar. the controls were uncomfortable, but i can see how i could eventually get used to them.
   the control options were limited as i could not assign movement to the d-pad.
   playing as the rotund pellet eater, i noticed that the class distinctions were clearer this time around.
   pac-man cozily nested in the middle of the spectrum, balancing speed and power.
   facing off against hulking foes such as charizard or bowser, their sluggishness was offset by their range and brute strength.
   however on the whole the combat did not feel very snappy, and often times the controls were to blame.
   executing moves was based off a “flick” based system, where you would have to flick the 3ds thumb pad along with your desired face button.
   initially it proved to be finicky, and i only honed the diverse move set after practicing.
    <br />
    <br />
    After a couple of hours of smashing (insert sexual remark here), the game grew on me like a hemorrhagic virus.
    A cohesive “story mode” would have been entertaining as I often wonder what type of circumstances would lead Pac-man and Charizard to battle (hue differences maybe?).
    Overall, fighting, spectating and betting (using in game gold) with friends and online players was much more fun that the main game.
    Others tiny things such as a dedicated Nintendo music player (with sleep functionality built in) and a wide assortment of trophies and challenges gave some extra depth to the game.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div class="closer">
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        I didn’t think that a portable smash game could work, but here was a nice little surprise that I’m sure everyone saw coming.
        It has rough edges, to be sure, but on the whole it works, especially with friends.
        I would recommend it for the hard-core fans, and especially for those people who only own a 3DS. Otherwise, I suggest holding out for the WiiU version.

            Free to play. Now when many people here that phrase, it’s usually followed by “sucks”. 
            For the most part they are correct, often times free to play games have a built in leeching mechanism that prompts users to “pay to win”. 
            In <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone</a> however, you can get all of the cards and expansions using in game gold, and given enough time, some players have even risen to the top without spending a dime.
    <br />
    <br />
    The game plays like a more condensed version of magic the gathering. The rules are easy to follow and the user interface is snappy and animated.
    Don’t be fooled by the cheesy voice acting and the simplistic play style, the game is chock-full of depth that unravels the more you play.
    Moreover the game is not necessarily steeped in Warcraft lore, and the cards do not have flavour text (but do have flavour audio, which sometimes come in the form of Monty Python references and other assorted cultural tropes).
    The single player mode is additive and the recently released “Curse of Naxxramus” features a few challenges and bosses that are quirky and a good diversion from the multiplayer.
    <br />
    <br />
    On that note, the multiplayer is generally fun, but for those not strategically inclined (guilty), you can easily get struck in a rut. However I was never frustrated by it.
    Just as a living city needs lowly peasants and day-in day-out workers, so does this game world.
    Clinging to the moss pit of the competitive ladder, I’ve already set up shop and quite like the cycle of uneventfulness.
    Analogous to real life, Hearthstone taught me that it’s ok (and rather pleasant, in a mind numbing sort of way) to suck and remain in the obscure.
    In fact, (from Blizzards own stat disclosure) 75% of Hearthstone players are in the 10 lowest ranks.
    Some attribute that to the “play to win” structure but whatever the case, the game is still fun for casual players (just like how taking a tepid shower after work is pleasant to an Indonesian sulfur miner).
    <br />
    <br />
    <div class="closer">
        <h2>Verdict</h2>
        Whether you play to win or play to, well… play, Hearthstone offers a very tidy package that is equal parts fun and more accessible than real trading card games.
        Chalk it up to availability, but before Hearthstone there really wasn’t a truly accessible online card game with this much polish.
        Coming in fresh and without baggage, I would definitely like to see how it evolves over the coming years. Definitely worth a play.
